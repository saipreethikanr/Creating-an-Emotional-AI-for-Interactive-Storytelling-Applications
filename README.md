# Creating-an-Emotional-AI-for-Interactive-Storytelling-Applications

## Overview
Our project explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized stories that reflect
user emotions, such as happiness, sadness, or excitement. By using sentiment-based prompts and integrating
character personalization, our model tailors narratives to individual moods. Leveraging the Ollama library,
the project supportsreal-time, interactive storytelling that adaptsto each user's emotional state. This approach
enhances engagement, fosters emotional expression, and creates a supportive environment for mental wellbeing through customized narratives. Initial results suggest promising applications in therapy, entertainment,
and personal growth. The project framework focuses on adaptive storytelling, ensuring relatable content that
resonates with users on a deeper level. Future development will expand emotion categories, improve
narrative coherence, and deepen personalization. We aim to provide an empathetic, immersive storytelling
experience that enriches user interaction and emotional support.
